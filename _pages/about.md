I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Statisical Physics of Complex Dynamics Laboratory (CoDyLab)](https://sites.google.com/site/codylab2/) in [Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.apctp.org/main/index.php), Korea. My research focuses on understanding social systems through data analysis and mathematical modeling, with a particular interest on urban science, economic complexity, knowledge structure and human mobility.
