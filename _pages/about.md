I am a PhD candidate at Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea, and a visiting predoctoral fellow at Kellogg School of Management and Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems. My research focuses on understanding social systems through data analysis and mathematical modeling, with a particular interest on economic complexity, knowledge structure, and human mobility.
