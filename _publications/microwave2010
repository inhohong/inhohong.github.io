The first prototype microwave imaging reflectometry (MIR) system [H. Park <i>et al.</i>, <i>Rev. Sci. Instrum.</i> <b>74</b>, 4239 (2004)] clearly demonstrated the shortcomings of conventional reflectometry when the probe beam encountered a large amplitude and/or high fluctuation wavenumber at the reflection layer in laboratory tests, the distinctive advantages shown in these tests were not fully realized in the plasma operation. To understand the discrepancies, the MIR system performance has been thoroughly investigated at POSTECH. In this paper, a possible cause of the MIR performance degradation on TEXTOR will be presented together with a concept of multifrequency MIR system design that will be developed for KSTAR.
